# Healti

Open source health monitor app built with Nuxt3 + Supabase.

This is an experiment to play with cool technologies while building something I wanted to for a while.

## Features & technologies

- Nuxt3 / Vue3
- Supabase for the BaaS
- Supabase Auth for authentication
- Nuxt-Supabase wrapper for the Supabase JS client
- NuxtLabs UI for UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vercel for deployment
- TypeScript

## Run Healti locally

1. Install the dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

2. Set up your Supabase environment variables in ```.env```.

3. Start the development server:

```
yarn dev
```
